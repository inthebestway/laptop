Laptop
======

Laptop is a script to set up an OS X laptop for web development.

It can be run multiple times on the same machine safely.
It installs, upgrades, or skips packages
based on what is already installed on the machine.

Requirements
------------

We support:

* [OS X Yosemite (10.10)](https://www.apple.com/osx/)

Older versions may work but aren't regularly tested. Bug reports for older
versions are welcome.

Install
-------

Download, review, then execute the script:

```sh
curl --remote-name https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mmatkinson/laptop/master/mac
curl --remote-name https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mmatkinson/laptop/master/.laptop.local

less mac
sh mac 2>&1 | tee ~/laptop.log
```

It should take less than 15 minutes to install (depends on your machine).

Customize in `~/.laptop.local`
------------------------------

Your `~/.laptop.local` is run at the end of the Laptop script.
Put your customizations there.
For example:

```sh
#!/bin/sh

brew_tap 'caskroom/cask'
brew_install_or_upgrade 'brew-cask'

brew cask install dropbox
brew cask install google-chrome
brew cask install rdio

gem_install_or_update 'parity'

brew_install_or_upgrade 'tree'
brew_install_or_upgrade 'watch'
```

Write your customizations such that they can be run safely more than once.
See the `mac` script for examples.

Laptop functions such as `fancy_echo`,
`brew_install_or_upgrade`, and
`gem_install_or_update`
can be used in your `~/.laptop.local`.

See the [wiki](https://github.com/thoughtbot/laptop/wiki)
for more customization examples.
